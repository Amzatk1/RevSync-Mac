⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

1. OFF-ROAD USE ONLY
Many ECU tunes and modifications are designed for closed-course competition use only and may not be legal for use on public roads or highways. You are responsible for complying with all local, state, and federal laws.

2. RISK OF DAMAGE
Modifying your vehicle's ECU can result in engine damage, powertrain failure, or other mechanical issues. RevSync provides tools for tuning but does not guarantee the safety or reliability of any specific tune file.

3. PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION
We strongly recommend that all tuning and hardware installation be performed by a qualified technician. Improper flashing can "brick" your ECU, rendering the vehicle inoperable.

4. NO LIABILITY
By using this app, you explicitly release RevSync Inc., its employees, and partners from any liability for property damage, personal injury, or death resulting from the use of this software or associated hardware.

5. EMERGENCY
Never attempt to use this app while riding. Always park your vehicle in a safe location before connecting diagnostics or flashing tunes.
