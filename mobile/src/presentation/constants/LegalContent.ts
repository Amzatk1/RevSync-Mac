Important: This document is a general template and should be reviewed by a qualified solicitor before production launch.

1. About RevSync
RevSync is a platform that provides access to ECU tune files (“Tunes”), flashing workflows, safety validation checks, and related services. RevSync may include marketplace features allowing third-party tuners (“Tuners”) to publish and sell Tunes.
Company details: [RevSync Legal Entity Name], [Registered Address], [Company Number], [Jurisdiction].

2. Definitions
- “Tune” means a calibration file, map, patch, or software update intended for an ECU.
- “Flashing” means writing a Tune or software to a vehicle ECU.
- “Device” means a compatible adapter/dongle/interface used to communicate with an ECU.
- “Digital Content” means Tune downloads and any associated digital files.
- “You” means the user/account holder.

3. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old to use RevSync. By using the app you confirm you are legally able to enter into these Terms.

4. Account Responsibilities
You are responsible for:
• keeping your login credentials secure
• ensuring your account details are accurate
• all activity carried out under your account

5. Product Nature (Digital Content)
Most Tunes and related downloads are digital content. Where permitted by law, once digital content has been accessed or downloaded, refunds and cancellation rights may be limited.
Where required, RevSync may ask you to consent to immediate delivery of digital content and acknowledge that you may lose certain cancellation rights once delivery begins. This does not affect statutory rights that cannot be excluded.

6. Safety-Critical Use
ECU flashing and vehicle modification can:
• damage the ECU/engine if interrupted
• affect rideability and safety
• impact warranty and insurance
• affect emissions compliance and road legality

You agree to use RevSync responsibly and follow all instructions and warnings shown in the app. You are responsible for ensuring your use of RevSync and any Tune complies with local laws and regulations. Some Tunes may be intended for off-road/track use only where indicated.

7. Compatibility & Validation
RevSync provides compatibility indicators and safety checks based on:
• information you provide about your bike
• ECU identification data read from the vehicle (where available)
• Tune metadata provided by the publisher
These checks reduce risk but do not guarantee the absence of problems.

8. Third-Party Tune Publishers (Marketplace)
Where RevSync hosts third-party Tunes:
• the Tuner is responsible for the Tune content, claims, and compatibility details they publish
• RevSync may perform automated checks, but does not guarantee performance outcomes
• you may be required to accept additional terms from a Tuner at purchase time
• disputes may require us to share limited compatibility context with the Tuner to provide support

9. Prohibited Use
You must not:
• attempt to bypass safety checks or validation gates
• reverse engineer or tamper with signed Tune files
• upload harmful or malicious content
• use the platform for illegal activity, including unlawful emissions tampering where prohibited
• harass, scam, or impersonate other users or Tuners

10. Fees & Payments
Prices are shown before purchase. Payment processing may be handled by third-party providers. You authorise RevSync to charge the displayed amount and applicable taxes/fees.

11. Updates & Changes
RevSync may update the app, device protocols, validation checks, Tune formats, or security measures to improve safety and compatibility. Some updates may be required for continued use.

12. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
• RevSync is not liable for indirect losses, including loss of profits, loss of use, or consequential damages
• RevSync is not liable for damage resulting from incorrect bike information, incompatible hardware, interrupted power, or failure to follow instructions
Nothing in these Terms limits liability where it cannot be limited by law (including for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or other non-excludable liability).

13. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold RevSync harmless from claims arising out of your misuse of the platform or violation of these Terms.

14. Termination
We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or create safety/security risks.

15. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of [England and Wales / your jurisdiction]. Courts of that jurisdiction will have exclusive authority unless applicable law states otherwise.

    SAFETY: `ECU Flashing Safety Disclaimer
RevSync enables access to ECU Tune files and flashing workflows. Flashing an ECU is a safety-critical process.

Key risks
• Power loss or interruption may corrupt ECU memory.
• Incorrect Tune selection can cause poor running, engine damage, or unsafe behaviour.
• Vehicle modifications may affect warranty, insurance validity, emissions compliance, and road legality.

Your responsibilities
By using RevSync you agree that you:
• have selected the correct bike and Tune for your ECU
• will follow the on-screen pre-flash checklist
• will ensure stable power (charger recommended)
• will not use the vehicle in unsafe conditions after flashing
• will test carefully in a controlled environment

Legal and compliance note
You are responsible for ensuring any Tune and vehicle modification complies with local laws and regulations. Where indicated, some Tunes may be intended for off-road/track use only.

No guarantee of outcomes
RevSync provides safety checks to reduce risk, but cannot guarantee:
• performance gains
• fuel economy changes
• emissions compliance
• avoidance of mechanical failure

If something goes wrong
Use the Recovery flow to restore a verified backup and contact support with exported logs.`,

    ACCEPTABLE_USE: `Acceptable Use Policy
You must not:
• bypass, disable, or attempt to trick safety checks
• distribute copyrighted or stolen Tune files
• tamper with signatures, checksums, or integrity checks
• use RevSync to perform illegal emissions tampering where prohibited
• harass, scam, or impersonate other users or Tuners

Because Tunes are digital content, refunds may be limited once a file has been downloaded or accessed.

We may offer refunds if:
• the Tune is proven incompatible due to incorrect listing metadata
• the file fails integrity checks repeatedly and cannot be delivered
• required by consumer law

Refunds are not typically provided if:
• you selected the wrong Tune for your bike

Where permitted by law, RevSync is not liable for:

• ECU damage
• warranty voiding
• insurance invalidation
• emissions non-compliance

This does not affect rights that cannot be excluded by law.`,
